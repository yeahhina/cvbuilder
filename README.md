## Getting started

This is the starting point for your cvbuilder coursework. 

# TB2 Software Development Coursework - CVBuilder App

# CV Builder App Start Code 

You have been provided with a basic Maven Project that includes a single package (cvbuilder) with a .gitkeep file in it. This should be the top-level package for your code and you should create other packages beneath this. You should clone this project as covered in (Using KUGitlab - Access and Workflow)[https://canvas.kingston.ac.uk/courses/29973/pages/unit-2-week-1] 

To get this sample code onto your local machine you will need to:

- [ ]  [Create a personal access token ](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#personal-access-tokens). This will be used to allow you to authenticate to GitLab.com/KUGitlab for the purposes of typical operations e.g. cloning and pushing to private repositories in your sub-group.  You will typically only need one personal access token but you can create a new one whenever you require it and delete old ones. 
- [] Optionally Import the Project into your Portfolio Namespace - for 'Self-imported Repository' if it hasn't been 'Pre-imported'. Check if the Repository is already in your Namespace 
- [ ]  [Clone this new Repository using your Personal Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html#clone-using-a-token). You can do this from an IDE (e.g. NetBeans) or from the command-line (e.g. Git Bash) 
- [ ] Use a Git development process (add, commit, push) to version manage your code.  This will be covered in the module but is [typically](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/commit.html). Currently your Portfolio Sub-Group has not been set-up and so you will not be able to push back your changes. You don't have the permission to do this to the origin repository - or else these changes would change the sample code for everyone else!

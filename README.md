# cvbuilder_9

## Getting started

This is the starting point for your cvbuilder coursework. The last number in the repo name should match the last number in your student id (Knumber). 

# TB2 Software Development Coursework - CVBuilder App

As part of Unit 2 - Software Application Development you have a [Java Software Application Development and Demo Assignment](https://canvas.kingston.ac.uk/courses/29973/pages/assessment-and-feedback-schedule-2) that is worth 30% of your total module mark.  There is a 'Coursework Assignment Brief' which details the Requirements and Assessment Criteria. It is important that you only do the Requirements (CV Sections) that are assigned to you according to the last number in your student id (Knumber). You are provided with some typical [data](./data/cv_repo_9.csv) to get you started with your application. The cvbuilder follows on from the Swing Portfolio Coursework that you did - in particular for the compulsory User Section of the CV. This is all discussed in the first workshop after EAW week [CI5105 TB2 Week 7 - Workshop](https://canvas.kingston.ac.uk/courses/29973/pages/topic-3-more-advanced-java)
 

You should follow a development process similar to the specified for your UserProfileBuilder i.e. you must develop your code in this repository with the correct use of KUGitlab with frequent commits and appropriate commit messages as you progress.

# CV Builder App Start Code 

You have been provided with a basic Maven Project that includes a single package (cvbuilder) with a .gitkeep file in it. This should be the top-level package for your code and you should create other packages beneath this. You should clone this project as covered in (Using KUGitlab - Access and Workflow)[https://canvas.kingston.ac.uk/courses/29973/pages/unit-2-week-1] 

To get this sample code onto your local machine you will need to:

- [ ]  [Create a personal access token ](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#personal-access-tokens). This will be used to allow you to authenticate to GitLab.com/KUGitlab for the purposes of typical operations e.g. cloning and pushing to private repositories in your sub-group.  You will typically only need one personal access token but you can create a new one whenever you require it and delete old ones. 
- [] Optionally Import the Project into your Portfolio Namespace - for 'Self-imported Repository' if it hasn't been 'Pre-imported'. Check if the Repository is already in your Namespace 
- [ ]  [Clone this new Repository using your Personal Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html#clone-using-a-token). You can do this from an IDE (e.g. NetBeans) or from the command-line (e.g. Git Bash) 
- [ ] Use a Git development process (add, commit, push) to version manage your code.  This will be covered in the module but is [typically](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/commit.html). Currently your Portfolio Sub-Group has not been set-up and so you will not be able to push back your changes. You don't have the permission to do this to the origin repository - or else these changes would change the sample code for everyone else!

# CV Builder

As part of the module "Programming II - Software Development", I have developed an application to manage Curriculum Vitae data.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this assignment were to:

- Gain hands-on experience in building a Java application with a Swing-based graphical user interface (GUI).
- Implement file input/output (I/O) functionality to store, manage, and retrieve CV data.
- Develop a system that allows users to create, edit, and update different sections of their Curriculum Vitae.
- Enable users to generate a custom CV tailored to specific job applications.

## Technologies Used

- Java – the main programming language used to build the application
- Java Swing – for developing the graphical user interface (GUI).
- File I/O (Java I/O classes) – for storing, managing, and retrieving CV data.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – to design and implement the data model.

The following are some screenshot of the software:
